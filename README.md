This is my main website repository, located at https://xmdb.dev. It contains details about my experience, skills, and projects. This project was started as a school assessment task in October 2019, and was built on from there! Before it used vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, but now it uses a combination of React, GatsbyJS, and TypeScript.

#### Huge thanks to Brittney Chiang for the original design and code! Her work is to be commemorated. I merely went through and added types and learnt about how it all worked, as well as added some of my own tweaks. You can find her website here: https://brittanychiang.com/
